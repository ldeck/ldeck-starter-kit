===========

**ldeck-starter-kit** is a work in progress example configuration of
  mine for my
  **[my-starter-kit](https://github.com/ldeck/my-starter-kit)**.
  
  You should refer to
  **[my-starter-kit](https://github.com/ldeck/my-starter-kit)** for
  guidelines on configuring your own local setup for emacs. This repo
  simply provides an example usage of it.

Ingredients
----------

The ingredients I've included so far centre around the following:

* ECB for IDE-like setup
* rinari for rails development, auto-activated
* autocomplete and rsense for autocompletion
* flymake-ruby for syntax errors
* feature-mode for cucumber tests
* markdown-mode for writing these READMEs
* zenburn theme for easy reading
* and a few others

TODO
----------

There's a swag of packages available for emacs that I'd like to
include in my own setup. I noted about 60 of them (!) after going
through the list of available packages from the various ELPA sources.

The overall objective is to have a viable config in emacs for
java/j2ee, scala, liftweb, ruby/rails, perl, lisp and so forth.
